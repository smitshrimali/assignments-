Q.1 Research and provide three real-world applications where C programming 
is extensively used, such as in embedded systems, operating systems, or game 
development. 
Ans. C programming is extensively used in many real-world applications due to 
its efficiency, low-level hardware access, and portability. Here are three major 
domains where C is widely employed


1. Embedded Systems 
C is the preferred language for developing software and drivers for embedded 
systems because it interacts closely with hardware. It is used in 
microcontrollers, consumer electronics, automotive systems, and IoT devices 
where resource constraints require efficient, low-level programming. 


2. Operating Systems 
Many foundational operating systems are written in C, including UNIX, Linux, 
Microsoft Windows, and parts of Android. Its low-level capabilities allow direct 
manipulation of hardware resources, memory management, and process control, 
making it ideal for system programming. 


3. Game Development and Graphics Software 
C is used to build –performance-critical game engines and graphics 
applications. Its speed advantage over interpreted languages is crucial for real
time rendering, physics simulations, and animation. Software like Adobe 
Photoshop and parts of game engines leverage C for core functionalities.
